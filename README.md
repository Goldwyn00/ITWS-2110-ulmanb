In this project I had to shake off a bit of rust with CSS. First I went back to reference some HTML and CSS from last year and review the in class notes to get refreshed on syntax. Then I started by looking at my other resumes I've used in the past and took some of the ideas from those such as categories of skills and experiences and added them here. I wanted my page sort of look like it was in dark mode as many applications I use are in dark mode. Initially I just used pure black and white, and struggle to quite figure out how to make it look a bit less intense and aggressive. I fixed this by using a dark gray for the background and a slightly off white for the text to make it look a little more pleasing to the eyes. Additinoally, I gave ample room for the text boxes to make sure that elements weren't too cluttered or busy. Overall the process was relatively smooth sailing with no major hiccups or issues, just getting refreshed on HTML and CSS syntax that I haven't worked with for a couple of months.
