This lab was relatively easy, I didn't struggle with the content because it's all review from last semester. The main thing I struggled with was finding time to do it, because this week I've been incredibly busy with back to back to back exams in three of my classes, so that was the main struggle I had. Other than that, it was mostly just reading the constitution which took a little while because of how different the language is from modern english. Those two things were really the biggest things that were a challenge for this lab.
