The major struggle with this assignment was getting started on JavaScript and ajax as that was where my memory was the foggiest. I starting by looking up
some tutorials on how to make API calls and from there got started on creating my basic file structure, and what goes in each file, and all the
steps that I needed to take. Once I figured that out, it was pretty straightforward, just having to come up with what I wanted my second API was and then figure out how to use it. I have an interest the the card game Magic: The Gathering and I thought it would be fun to use the Scryfall API. Scryfall is a powerful search engine for M:TG cards which allows you to query almost any card attributes you could want. I decided that I would use the Scryfall API to serve a random card to the user every time they load the page, then tell them how much that card is worth.
